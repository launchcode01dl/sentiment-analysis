# sentiment-analysis
Sentiment analysis of IMDB reviews to predict their inclination toward one particular emotion(positive or negative).
* I made this after watching the Sentiment Analysis assignment by Andrew Trask in the Udacity Neural Networks Nanodegree which my      friend was doing. 
* To run this, clone the repository and extract the reviews.zip in the same folder, you will get the reviews.txt.
* Now run the **project.py**
